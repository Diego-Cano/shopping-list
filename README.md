# shopping-list

 In my shopping list project, I found useImmer incredibly helpful for simplifying complex state management. It allowed me to directly update item details as though I could modify them in place, eliminating the risk of unintended changes. This approach saved me from dealing with complicated code and made my updates safer and more intuitive. It was particularly beneficial for adjusting nested details like item categories and notes, making my code cleaner and easier to manage.
